The following libraries are required for the Arduino code to work:

https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder
https://github.com/tomstewart89/StateSpaceControl
https://github.com/AndreaLombardo/L298N

1. Download the files by following each link and using the green "Clone or download" button
2. Add them to your Arduino IDE by navigating to "Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library..." then select each downloaded library
3. Add the following code to the end of "Model.h", which should be located in "Documents > Arduino > libraries > StateSpaceControl-master":

/* This model describes the IPECS rotary inverted pendulum with states, inputs, and outputs defined as:
 *
 * x = [theta, alpha, dtheta, dalpha]
 * u = [Vm]
 * y = [theta, alpha]
 *
 * Certain elements from the A and B matrices are required, which are defined in the accompanying MATLAB code. The required inputs to the InvPendModel model declaration can be easily copy/pasted from the MATLAB code.
 */

{
    InvPendModel(float A32, float A33, float A34, float A42, float A43, float A44, float B31, float B41)
