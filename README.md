This repository includes the MATLAB design code used for developing and designing the IPECS controller, along with the C/C++ code used for controlling the device.

The IPECS is an educational tool intended for use at Drexel University. It was designed to get controls students engaged in their controls classes, and to give professors a portable, simple-to-use, and inexpensive device to demonstrate the application of controls theory to their students.
